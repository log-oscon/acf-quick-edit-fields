Developers note
---------------
This plugin is still a stub. I am not quite sure if I will continue developing it.
If you encounter an issue or wish for a certain feature, please do not ask me to
fix it for you. I will not, but I would really appreciate when you fix it youself
and send me a pull request.

ToDo:
-----
 - [ ] Code Docs
 - [x] Plugin localization
 - [ ] Nice Format for `color_picker` and `date_picker` fields
